# Honours
The "Code" folder contains all relevant code used for completion of my thesis "A Bayesian Clustering Approach for Multivariate RNA Splicing Data".

All functions for fitting a multivariate mNDP are available in the file "Multivariate mNDP Functions.R". The other two functions files have helper functions specifically related to creating plots and analysis for the thesis.

Files beginning with numbers relate to chapter 5: "Analysis of PSI data". Files beginning with "Sim" relate to the simulation study in the second half of chapter 4: "Multivariate mNDP".
